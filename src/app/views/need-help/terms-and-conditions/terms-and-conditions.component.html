                        destiny. Byron and Shelley are the prime instances of this vital pose. In The Giaour he
                        writes on a vampiric character: “The common crowd but see the gloom/ Of wayward deeds and

                        disgrace by marrying an in-keeper’s daughter; he always struggled to reconcile his origin
                        with his political ideas: “Shelley could find no way of resolving his own contradictory
                        opinions” (Cronin, 2000).</p>
